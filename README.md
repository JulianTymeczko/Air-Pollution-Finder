## Project Name

Air-/Air B&B

![ScreenShot](./ScreenShot.png)
## Project Description

In a world where climate change is impacting our day to day lives in an increasing amount, soon an added step to your travels will not only be to check the relative safety of a location but also the environmental safety as air qualities change alongside our planets health.

API 1 takes a user input for a city/location they want to Air B&B, which then interacts with API2 to get air quality in that city/location.

Target Audience:
Travel + Health and wellness

## User Story

AS a USER I want to be able to search for an air B&B city, and check its air quality.
AS a USER I want to be able to interact with the application,
AS a USER I want to see a polished UI, which reacts dynamically to my input.
